# Scraper
Scraper is a web application that scrapes weather information about any city in the world from an OpenWeatherMaps API.

# How it was made
The back end of the web application was written in python and developed in the flask framework. An OpenWeatherMaps API is used to obtain information about the
cities, including the temperature, sunrise, humidity, air pressure etc. The HTTP library 'requests' is used to obtain the dictionary of information from the API.

The front end of the application is designed in html and css, using a bootstrap navbar template and simple background images.
