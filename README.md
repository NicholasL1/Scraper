# Scraper
Scraper is a web application that scrapes weather information about any city in the world from an OpenWeatherMaps API.

# How it was made
The back end of the web application was written in python and developed in the flask framework. An OpenWeatherMaps API is used to obtain information about the
cities, including the temperature, sunrise, humidity, air pressure etc. The HTTP library 'requests' is used to obtain the dictionary of information from the API.

The front end of the application is designed in html and css, using a bootstrap navbar template and simple background images.

# How to use
To run this project please use the following commands:

To make sure the latest version of pip is installed, run 
### pip3 install --upgrade pip

Now you can install the necessary packages with:
### pip install -r requirements.txt

If that doesn't work, you can try installing the packages individually:
### pip install flask requests datetime
or
###pip install flask
###pip install requests
###pip install datetime

You can now run the app with: 

###python app.py
